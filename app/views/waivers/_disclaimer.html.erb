<p>I hereby invite to my home and property, volunteers who were referred to me by ServeMoore and Service International.  ServeMoore and Service International has no insurance coverage for protection against legal claims of liability damage suits that might arise as a result of the work of volunteers on my property.  Therefore, in consideration of the voluntary services rendered to me by volunteers of ServeMoore and Service International, I hereby waive any and all claims of demands that may arise or accrue to me, growing out of negligent acts of omissions by said organization or any of its members or helpers in rendering such voluntary service and specifically covenants not to sue it or them for any of said negligent acts of omissions.</p>
